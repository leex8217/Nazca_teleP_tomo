# Nazca_teleP_tomo

Hi,

I upload depth slices of teleseismic dVp/Vp with prescribed anisotropy to study the mantle structure of the Nazca Plate beneath the Nazca Ridge and the Iquique Ridge (Latitude 10-22 deg S, Longitude 65 - 79 deg W).
Further details on the velocity model would be available soon (scientific publication is under review). 

Please let me know if you have any inquiries.
